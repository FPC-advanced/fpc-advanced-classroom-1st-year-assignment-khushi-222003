/* Write program to find the weight of a truck load of n camels.

Take inputs for:
- truck weight
- height, radius and length of n different camels

> `total_truck_weight = truck_weight + weight_of_camels`

***Function Declarations***
```c
typedef struct _camel {
    float radius, height, length, weight;
} Camel;

void input(int n, Camel c[n], float *truck_weight);
void find_camel_weight(int n, Camel c[n]);
float compute_total_weight(int n, Camel c[n], float truck_weight);
void output(float total_weight);
